# CS460G-Recurrent-Neural-Network
Machine Learning Recurrent Neural Network Program for my senior year CS460G course.

# Repository Information

Running the rnn-char.py trains and samples a character based recurrent neural network using the PyTorch library
Running the rnn-word.py trains and samples a word based recurrent neural network using the PyTorch library
Both of these files need the tiny-shakespeare.txt in the same directory to run
If cuda GPU is available to use the PyTorch model will use it. If not CPU will be used.
